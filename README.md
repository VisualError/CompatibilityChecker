# CompatibilityChecker (Thanks Bobbie for the name suggestion.)

## Overview

Enhances your multiplayer experience by notifying you of the required mods when failing to join modded servers.

## Features

- **Automatic Mod Notification**: Modded servers will now notify you of the required mods upon a non-successful join.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/) installed.
2. Download the latest release of the CompatibilityChecker mod from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Ryokune/CompatibilityChecker/).
3. Extract the contents into your Lethal Company's `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

## How It Works

- The mod automatically notifies you of required mods when joining modded servers.
- Mod information is shared between players through the Steam lobby.
